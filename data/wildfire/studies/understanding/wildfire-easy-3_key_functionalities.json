    "Load USA state boundaries (usa.gpkg) and NIFC Geographic Area polygons (nifc_geographic_areas.gpkg) into two geo dataframes.",
    "Re-project the NIFC geo data so both layers share the same CRS, ensuring spatial operations are valid.",
    "Dissolve the USA layer by the state name column ('adm1_name') so each state is represented by a single multipart geometry.",
    "Perform a spatial join (predicate='intersects') between the dissolved state geometries and NIFC polygons to associate each state with all NIFC regions it touches.",
    "Group the joined data by state; for each state compute (a) the count of distinct NIFC regions (nunique of 'GACCAbbreviation') and (b) the list of those unique region codes.",
    "Determine which states intersect the largest number of regions."
