In 2024, solar storms have lit up the skies with stunning Auroras across the United States. But while these displays are captivating to observers on the ground, space weather has the potential to wreak havoc on our global satellite infrastructure. Geomagnetic storms cause rapid heating in Earth’s thermosphere, which can lead to more than a 10x increase in satellite drag in mere hours. 
In May 2024, the Gannon storm caused the largest mass migration of satellites in history and severely degraded satellite collision avoidance systems worldwide for multiple days

    Description: All the data to which this interface and its multiple underlying interfaces provide access have in common that they are relevant to heliospheric studies and/or provide solar wind input data for studies of solar wind - magnetosphere coupling, and that they are resident at GSFC/Space Physics Data Facility.
    Most important among of them are Low and High res.

    Description: Swarm is the fifth mission in ESA’s fleet of Earth Explorers that was selected in 2004 in ESA’s Living Planet Programme. While other Earth Explorers only use one satellite, Swarm comprises a constellation of three satellites in near-polar low orbits to obtain better and more varied measurements. The Swarm mission was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome on 22 November 2013. 
    The mission studies the magnetic field and its temporal evolution providing the best-ever survey of the geomagnetic field. Its data help to improve our understanding of ocean currents and interactions in the atmosphere, electric currents in the ionosphere and their connection to the magnetosphere. The international Swarm DISC consortium is formed to support frontier research and enhance the scientific return of the Swarm mission.

    The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-R Series is the current generation of NOAA geostationary weather satellites. It has significantly improved capacity to detect and observe environmental phenomena, resulting in improved public safety, more accurate forecasts, and better protection of property.
