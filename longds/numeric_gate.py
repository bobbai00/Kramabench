"""Numeric parity gate: do LongDS's published answers reproduce in OUR venv?

The gold answers were computed against the benchmark's frozen 181-package Python
stack, and the LongDS judge demands exact numeric equality with no rounding. If
our pandas/numpy produce different digits, a correct method grades 0 and the
benchmark measures our library versions instead of our agent. So: run their gold
`task.py` here and diff every published answer against `task.json`.

Three things about that gold code make this less direct than it sounds, and all
three vary from task to task, so the gate handles them by shape rather than by a
per-task rule:

  * **No imports.** They lived in a notebook cell that was not exported, so a
    PRELUDE supplies them.
  * **Notebook-relative data paths.** Some tasks bind one
    `../../../../../data/longds/<task>` literal (called ROOT, DATA_DIR or
    base_path depending on the task); others use bare `data/...` strings. Both
    are fixed by running with the task's own data root as the cwd and collapsing
    that walk-up prefix to `.`.
  * **Two different ways of publishing an answer.** Some tasks accumulate an
    `answers` dict; others just `print(json.dumps(...))` per turn and keep
    nothing. So the file is split on its `###### Task N:` markers and executed
    one turn at a time in a single shared namespace, with that turn's stdout
    captured — which gives an exact turn-to-answer mapping either way, and
    localizes a failure to the turn that caused it instead of losing the whole
    task.
