"""LongDS experiment arms.

Deliberately NOT registered in `systems/__init__.py`: these are instantiated
directly by `run_longds.py`, and KramaBench's own harness must never pick them up
(they answer a multi-turn protocol it cannot drive). Keeping them here also means
adding a LongDS arm cannot disturb a KramaBench arm.

Baseline is the same knob set as the campaign's `_LunaAnchor` — DELTA, 1k result
chars, no stats, no code-in-snapshot — so LongDS numbers sit next to the gpt-5.6
KramaBench Anchor without a knob translation step. Two deliberate differences:

  * `max_steps=40` (LongDS's own per-turn cap) instead of 25. LakeQA showed the
    step cap binds first on harder benchmarks, and LongDS turn 1 has to build the
    whole analytical state from raw files.
  * `agent_service_endpoint` is :3001, the main checkout. `_LunaBase` defaults to
    :3004 (the code-lean worktree), which is not running.

`context_window_tokens=0` is the append-only condition: DELTA replays every
turn's events and nothing is trimmed by a token budget. It is already the default
— stated explicitly because for this benchmark it is a design choice, not an
inherited default.

    differently. What changed under it:

      * No `# Session Brief`. A session is one conversation and turn 1 is

        verbatim in the catalogue instead of clipped to a 260-char gist, which

        catalogue was misreporting the agent's own prior results on three turns
        in four.
      * `recallState` is addressed by TURN only. The five-way `what` selector is
        gone; one call returns a turn's request, answer and operator delta, and
        the caller chooses the verbosity (`includeCode`, `includeResults`,
        `includeStats`, `maxResultChars`) instead of a fixed policy choosing for
        it. The char budget is clamped service-side, because a recalled block is
        re-sent on every remaining step of the turn.
      * No cap on how many of the turn's own operators render their code.

    default since the A/B that settled it — same accuracy, cheaper, faster.)

      * At 12 the same constant FLOODS a big DAG. NFL and uber reached 360-600 kB
        of context and spent turn after turn burning the entire 40-step budget to
        return an empty answer; both runs were abandoned.
      * 24 is slightly WORSE than 12 on passnyc (73.3 vs 76.7), so retirement is
        worth keeping — the index is what buys the cost reduction — and the old
        default was simply far too aggressive.

    A turn count cannot satisfy all of those at once, because 12 turns of a
    31-operator task and 12 turns of a 381-operator task are not the same amount
    of context. The replacement bounds the COUNT of detailed operators (default
    40) with the turn's own work exempt: small DAGs keep everything, large ones

    `recallState` still only READS. The index cap is OFF
    (`indexDetailedOperators: 0`), so the two size mechanisms can be told apart:
    whatever this arm saves has to come from choosing a smaller base, not from a
    render budget.

    Why a tree rather than a line, measured over the ten tasks:

      * 47% of turns' newest dependency is NOT the previous turn.
      * Half of all counterfactual turns are depended on again later, so those

    new operators far more often than it revises old ones, which leaves history

        substantive numbers must trace to a materialized operator result or to
        state recalled this turn; on total failure the agent gets ONE feedback
        round. This checks a property only a dataflow has — results are

        mechanically decidable. Target: the measured late-turn failure where
        answers restate an earlier turn (pilot turns 29/32/42 answered in ~1
        step), and the paper's finding that verification collapses late
        (steps/turn drop 4.3, Fig 6d).
      * **Restore-via-recall** (prompt). For "as it originally was" requests:
        recall the owning turn's code and rebuild it VERBATIM as new operators.
        Drift-free because the code is copied from the record, state-safe
        because nothing moves — the lesson of the resumeFrom experiment, where
        wrong-base checkouts destroyed state (passnyc 73.3% -> 23.3%).
      * **Conventions never expire** (prompt). Rules stated in any turn bind
        until changed; copy their constants from the catalogue, later statement
        wins. Target: the wrong-formula cascade's root (pilot turn 3 guessed a
        convention turn 1 had stated; 6 later turns inherited the drift).
