"""LongDS experiment arms.

Deliberately NOT registered in `systems/__init__.py`: these are instantiated
directly by `run_longds.py`, and KramaBench's own harness must never pick them up
(they answer a multi-turn protocol it cannot drive). Keeping them here also means
adding a LongDS arm cannot disturb a KramaBench arm.

Baseline is the same knob set as the campaign's `_LunaAnchor` — DELTA, 1k result
chars, no stats, no code-in-snapshot — so LongDS numbers sit next to the gpt-5.6
KramaBench Anchor without a knob translation step. Two deliberate differences:

  * `max_steps=40` (LongDS's own per-turn cap) instead of 25. LakeQA showed the
    step cap binds first on harder benchmarks, and LongDS turn 1 has to build the
    whole analytical state from raw files.
  * `agent_service_endpoint` is :3001, the main checkout. `_LunaBase` defaults to
    :3004 (the code-lean worktree), which is not running.

`context_window_tokens=0` is the append-only condition: DELTA replays every
turn's events and nothing is trimmed by a token budget. It is already the default
— stated explicitly because for this benchmark it is a design choice, not an
inherited default.
