        "query": "What is the cumulative cash outflow related to restructuring payments and other adjustments from 2021 to 2023, and how does this impact the company's liquidity if the starting cash balance in 2021 was $1,200 million?",
        "answer": "Given that the starting cash balance in 2021 was $1,200 million, we can assess the liquidity impact by subtracting the total cash outflow over the period from the initial balance: starting cash balance (2021): $1,200 million. Total cash outflow (2021-2023): $(1,769) million. Ending cash balance $569 millions. This indicates that, without other cash inflows or adjustments, the company would have faced a cash shortfall of $569 million by the end of 2023, potentially impacting its liquidity position. However, this shortfall is theoretical based only on the restructuring-related cash flows, and other factors such as revenue, financing, and operational cash flows could affect the actual liquidity outcome.",
