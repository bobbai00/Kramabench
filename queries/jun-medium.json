        "query": "Explain the difference between the \"charges associated with the integration plan\" and the \"cash activity in the recorded liability\" section. How does each one impact the company's financial statements differently?",
        "answer": "Charges associated with the integration plan represent the total costs incurred (expenses) related to the integration of Allergan, such as R&D, SG&A, and cost of products sold. These are recorded on the income statement and impact net income. Cash activity in the recorded liability tracks how much cash has been actually paid out for those expenses or obligations. It provides information about the cash flow and is reflected on the cash flow statement. The key difference is that charges are an accrual accounting entry, while cash activity tracks actual payments. For instance, charges can be recorded in a period, but the payment may happen later (in the following year, for example), which affects the cash flow but not the income statement in the same period.",

        "answer": "The total restructuring charges decreased by approximately 45.23% from 2022 to 2023. This significant drop suggests that the company might be nearing the completion of major restructuring activities or has scaled back such efforts. As an investor, this reduction could signal cost stabilization, but it would be important to monitor whether the expected benefits of these restructuring efforts have been realized.",

        "answer": " The ratio of cash payments to restructuring charges in 2023 is approximately 81.3%. A ratio of less than 100% indicates that not all restructuring charges are being paid in the same year; part of the charges is carried forward as accrued liabilities. This suggests the company is managing restructuring cash outflows over multiple periods, potentially easing short-term liquidity pressures. However, it also means future cash flow commitments will continue to be impacted by these charges.",
